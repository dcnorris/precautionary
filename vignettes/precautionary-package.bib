	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients in phase I clinical trials are treated at doses of chemotherapeutic agents that are below the biologically active level, thus reducing their chances for therapeutic benefit. Current phase I trials often take a long time to complete and provide little information about interpatient variability or cumulative toxicity.
PURPOSE: Our objective was to develop alternative designs for phase I trials so that fewer patients are treated at subtherapeutic dose levels, trials are of reduced duration, and important information (i.e., cumulative toxicity and maximum tolerated dose) needed to plan phase II trials is obtained.
METHODS: We fit a stochastic model to data from 20 phase I trials involving the study of nine different drugs. We then simulated new data from the model with the parameters estimated from the actual trials and evaluated the performance of alternative phase I designs on this simulated data. Four designs were evaluated. Design 1 was a conventional design (similar to the commonly used modified Fibonacci method) using cohorts of three to six patients, with 40\% dose-step increments and no intrapatient dose escalation. Designs 2 through 4 included only one patient per cohort until one patient experienced dose-limiting toxic effects or two patients experienced grade 2 toxic effects (during their first course of treatment for designs 2 and 3 or during any course of treatment for design 4). Designs 3 and 4 used 100\% dose steps during this initial accelerated phase. After the initial accelerated phase, designs 2 through 4 resorted to standard cohorts of three to six patients, with 40\% dose-step increments. Designs 2 through 4 used intrapatient dose escalation if the worst toxicity is grade 0-1 in the previous course for that patient.
RESULTS: Only three of the actual trials demonstrated cumulative toxic effects of the chemotherapeutic agents in patients. The average number of patients required for a phase I trial was reduced from 39.9 for design 1 to 24.4, 20.7, and 21.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients who would be expected to have grade 0-1 toxicity as their worst toxicity over three cycles of treatment is 23.3 for design 1, but only 7.9, 3.9, and 4.8 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients with grade 3 toxicity as their worst toxicity increases from 5.5 for design 1 to 6.2, 6.8, and 6.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The average number of patients with grade 4 toxicity as their worst toxicity increases from 1.9 for design 1 to 3.0, 4.3, and 3.2 for designs 2, 3, and 4, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Accelerated titration (i.e., rapid intrapatient drug dose escalation) designs appear to effectively reduce the number of patients who are under-treated, speed the completion of phase I trials, and provide a substantial increase in the information obtained.},

	abstract = {Purpose To shorten the study conduct timeline of pediatric phase I oncology trials by employing a novel trial design.   Methods A comparison of the traditional 3 + 3 patients per cohort, phase I trial design with a novel, rolling six design was performed by using discrete event simulation. The rolling six design allows for accrual of two to six patients concurrently onto a dose level based on the number of patients currently enrolled and evaluable, the number experiencing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and the number still at risk of developing a DLT. Clinical trial simulations (n = 1,000) were based on historical data and were performed using SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Study timelines and patient numbers were determined for each design, and safety was assessed as a function of the number of DLTs observed.   Results In twelve completed historical studies, the median time to study completion was 452 days (range, 220 to 606 days); number of evaluable participants enrolled was 22 (range, 11 to 33), and DLTs occurring per study was three (range, 0 to 5). In 1,000 study simulations, in which the average time to new patient accrual was 10 days, the average ± standard deviation (SD) time to study completion was 294 ± 75 days for the rolling six design versus 350 ± 84 days for the 3 + 3 design, whereas the number of DLTs per study was the same (average ± SD, 3.3 ± 1.1 v 3.2 ± 1.1 for the rolling six and 3 + 3 designs, respectively).   Conclusion The rolling six design may significantly decrease the duration of pediatric phase I studies without increasing the risk of toxicity. The design will be tested prospectively in upcoming Children's Oncology Group phase I trials.},

Motived by this practical consideration, we propose Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) designs to find the maximum tolerated dose and to minimize the probability of inappropriate dose assignments for patients. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the BOIN design not only has superior finite and large sample properties but also can be easily implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional ‘3+3’ design. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields comparable average performance to select the maximum tolerated dose but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses. We apply the BOIN design to two cancer clinical trials.},

	doi = {10.1101/240846},
	abstract = {Background Coherence notions have a long history in statistics, as rhetorical devices that support the critical examination of statistical doctrines and practices. Within the special domain of dose-finding methodology, a widely-discussed coherence criterion has been advanced as a means to guard the conceptual integrity of formal dose-finding designs from ad hoc tinkering. This is not, however, the only possible coherence criterion relevant to dose finding. Indeed, a new coherence criterion emerges naturally when the near-universal practice of cohort-wise dose escalation is examined from a clinical perspective.Methods The practice of enrolling drug-naive patients into an escalation cohort is considered from a realistic perspective that acknowledges patients’ heterogeneity with respect to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A new coherence criterion thereby emerges, requiring that an escalation dose be tried preferentially in participants who have already tolerated a lower dose, rather than in new enrollees who are drug-naive. The logical implications of this ‘precautionary coherence’ (PC) criterion are worked out in the setting of a 3+3 design. A ‘3+3/PC’ design that satisfies this criterion is described and visualized. A simulation study is performed, evaluating the long-run performance of this new design, relative to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Results Under the PC criterion, the 3+3 dose-escalation design necessarily transmutes into a dose titration design. Two simple rules suffice to enable abandonment of low starting doses, and termination of escalation. The process of conducting the 3+3/PC trial itself models the application of a dose titration algorithm (DTA) that carries over readily into clinical care. The 3+3/PC trial also yields an interval-censored ‘dose-survival curve’ having a semantics that should prove familiar to oncology trialists. Simulated 3+3/PC trials yield DTAs over a median of 6 dose levels, achieving 50\% improved population-level efficacy compared to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Conclusions Dose individualization can be accomplished within a trial conducted along ‘algorithmic’ lines resembling those of the inveterate 3+3 design. The dose-survival curve arising from this ‘3+3/PC’ design has semantics that should prove familiar and conceptually accessible to oncology trialists, and also seems capable of supporting more formal statistical treatments of the design. In the presence of sufficient heterogeneity in individualized optimal dosing, a 3+3/PC trial outperforms any conceivable 1-size-fits-all dose-finding design. This fact eliminates the rationale for the latter designs, and should put an end to the further development and promulgation of 1-size-fits-all dose finding.},

	abstract = {The commonplace description of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology as "primarily concerned with safety" is belied by their near universal adoption of dose-escalation practices which are inherently unsafe. In contrast with dose titration, cohort-wise dose escalation regards patients as exchangeable, an indefensible assumption in the face of widely appreciated inter-individual heterogeneity in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD). I have previously advanced this argument in terms of a precautionary coherence principle that brings the well-known coherence notion of Cheung (2005) into contact with modern imperatives of patient-centeredness and precision dosing. Here, however, I explore these matters in some mechanistic detail by analyzing a trial of the bispecific T cell engager AFM11, in which a fatal toxicity occurred. To this end, I develop a Bayesian dose-response model for a single ordinal toxicity. By constructing this model's priors to align with the AFM11 trial as designed and conducted, I demonstrate the incompatibility of that design with any reasonable expectation of safety. Indeed, the model readily yields prospective estimates of toxic response probabilities that suggest the fatality in this trial could have been foreseen as likely.},

The therapeutic index (TI)--which is typically considered as the ratio of the highest exposure to the drug that results in no toxicity to the exposure that produces the desired efficacy--is an important parameter in efforts to achieve this balance. Various types of safety and efficacy data are generated in vitro and in vivo (in animals and in humans), and these data can be used to predict the clinical TI of a drug candidate at an early stage. However, approaches to systematically and quantitatively compare these types of data and to apply this knowledge more effectively are needed.
