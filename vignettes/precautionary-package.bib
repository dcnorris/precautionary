	abstract = {In phase I trials, effectively treating patients and minimizing the chance of exposing them to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses are clinicians' top priority. Motived by this practical consideration, we propose Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) designs to find the maximum tolerated dose and to minimize the probability of inappropriate dose assignments for patients. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the BOIN design not only has superior finite and large sample properties but also can be easily implemented in a simple way similar to the traditional ‘3+3’ design. Compared with the well-known continual reassessment method, the BOIN design yields comparable average performance to select the maximum tolerated dose but has a substantially lower risk of assigning patients to subtherapeutic and overly toxic doses. We apply the BOIN design to two cancer clinical trials.},

	doi = {10.1101/240846},
	abstract = {Background Coherence notions have a long history in statistics, as rhetorical devices that support the critical examination of statistical doctrines and practices. Within the special domain of dose-finding methodology, a widely-discussed coherence criterion has been advanced as a means to guard the conceptual integrity of formal dose-finding designs from ad hoc tinkering. This is not, however, the only possible coherence criterion relevant to dose finding. Indeed, a new coherence criterion emerges naturally when the near-universal practice of cohort-wise dose escalation is examined from a clinical perspective.Methods The practice of enrolling drug-naive patients into an escalation cohort is considered from a realistic perspective that acknowledges patients’ heterogeneity with respect to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. A new coherence criterion thereby emerges, requiring that an escalation dose be tried preferentially in participants who have already tolerated a lower dose, rather than in new enrollees who are drug-naive. The logical implications of this ‘precautionary coherence’ (PC) criterion are worked out in the setting of a 3+3 design. A ‘3+3/PC’ design that satisfies this criterion is described and visualized. A simulation study is performed, evaluating the long-run performance of this new design, relative to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Results Under the PC criterion, the 3+3 dose-escalation design necessarily transmutes into a dose titration design. Two simple rules suffice to enable abandonment of low starting doses, and termination of escalation. The process of conducting the 3+3/PC trial itself models the application of a dose titration algorithm (DTA) that carries over readily into clinical care. The 3+3/PC trial also yields an interval-censored ‘dose-survival curve’ having a semantics that should prove familiar to oncology trialists. Simulated 3+3/PC trials yield DTAs over a median of 6 dose levels, achieving 50\% improved population-level efficacy compared to optimal 1-size-fits-all dosing.Conclusions Dose individualization can be accomplished within a trial conducted along ‘algorithmic’ lines resembling those of the inveterate 3+3 design. The dose-survival curve arising from this ‘3+3/PC’ design has semantics that should prove familiar and conceptually accessible to oncology trialists, and also seems capable of supporting more formal statistical treatments of the design. In the presence of sufficient heterogeneity in individualized optimal dosing, a 3+3/PC trial outperforms any conceivable 1-size-fits-all dose-finding design. This fact eliminates the rationale for the latter designs, and should put an end to the further development and promulgation of 1-size-fits-all dose finding.},

	abstract = {The commonplace description of phase 1 clinical trials in oncology as "primarily concerned with safety" is belied by their near universal adoption of dose-escalation practices which are inherently unsafe. In contrast with dose titration, cohort-wise dose escalation regards patients as exchangeable, an indefensible assumption in the face of widely appreciated inter-individual heterogeneity in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PKPD). I have previously advanced this argument in terms of a precautionary coherence principle that brings the well-known coherence notion of Cheung (2005) into contact with modern imperatives of patient-centeredness and precision dosing. Here, however, I explore these matters in some mechanistic detail by analyzing a trial of the bispecific T cell engager AFM11, in which a fatal toxicity occurred. To this end, I develop a Bayesian dose-response model for a single ordinal toxicity. By constructing this model's priors to align with the AFM11 trial as designed and conducted, I demonstrate the incompatibility of that design with any reasonable expectation of safety. Indeed, the model readily yields prospective estimates of toxic response probabilities that suggest the fatality in this trial could have been foreseen as likely.},
