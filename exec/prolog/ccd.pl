/*

The 'cumulative-cohort design' (CCD) concept in [1] establishes a class of
dose-escalation designs in which escalation decisions are a function strictly
of the cumulative toxicity rate AT THE CURRENT DOSE. These designs are thus
positioned midway between what [1] calls 'group designs' (in which escalation
depends only on the rate observed in the current COHORT), and general designs
where these decisions depend on the observed rates AT ALL DOSES. (Note that,
in the dose-escalation context where patients are treated as *exchangeable*,
the list of dose-wise tallies [T1/N1, T2/N2, ..., Td/Nd] is a sufficient
statistic for the full history of the trial.)

With its 'middling' size, this CCD class seems likely to be amenable to modes
of analysis that Prolog and CLP(â„¤) can bring to bear. But also apparently CCD
is general enough to encompass BOIN [2] and other interval-based methods such
as mTPI [3].

Indeed, even the analytical approach pursued in [1] invites comparison with
what we may attempt here by quite different---and, I think, more powerful &
suitable---methods. Whereas Ivanova, Flournoy & Chung attempt to reduce CCDs
to locally equivalent group designs, we might aim toward a similar analysis
of CRM and other such designs via their local approximation as CCDs!

Moreover, the effort in [1] towards gaining sharp control over the cardinality
of the design space also anticipates some of the challenges we will face here.

What we here call 'CCD' owes something to the generalizations drawn from [2],
especially the argument (starting at the bottom of p.514) that dose removal
boundaries are generally necessary in these designs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While it seems appropriate to retain the apt term "cumulative cohort design",
we can go beyond the limited terms in which CCDs were defined and optimized
in [1]. The implementation of [2] actually points the way here.

Table 2 in Liu & Yuan is especially helpful, suggesting that a general class
of transition rules may be relatively easy to specify in CLP terms, without
recourse to whatever Real-analytic computations might be used as heuristics
for *finding* them:

             cumulative patients treated at current dose (n_j):
              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12

lambda_{1,j} 0/1  0/2  0/3  0/4  0/5  0/6  0/7  1/8  1/9  1/10  1/11  1/12

lambda_{2,j} 1/1  2/2  2/3  2/4  3/5  3/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  5/11  6/12

elimination   -    -   3/3  3/4  3/5  4/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  6/11  6/12


The dose-elimination concept also readily invites computations over *lists*,
which are subject to truncation in the same manner.

Furthermore, with the 'local BOIN' design having so few free parameters (indeed,
under the default choice delta = +/-40%, the target toxicity rate is all that we
have left!), we obtain the real possibility of caching precomputed T arrays for
a finite number of possible designs! Thus, we might cache BOIN T arrays on a grid
of (TTR,D) in {0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3} x {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} which amounts to
only 30 distinct arrays. (An interesting question is whether it might suffice to
cache only the D=8 arrays, and then collapse these to the D<8 arrays by a quick
array computation. In this case, it might well be reasonable to cache on a finer
TTR grid.)

Also helpful for situating this type of design within a 'taxonomy' is [2], with
its notion of a 'cumulative cohort design'. This is a design where the escalation
decisions are made solely on the tally *at the current dose*, without regard to
the tallies at other doses. This is the basic pattern to be implemented here,
albeit with elimination of overly-toxic doses which departs from strict CCD form.

/*

Drawing inspiration from BOIN [2] as a specific example of cumulative-cohort
designs, we posit that in CCDs in general, dose-escalation decisions are
driven solely from BOUNDARY-HITTING EVENTS captured by =< and >= relations.
The boundaries are of 2 types: FLOORS that (when hit) indicate escalation,
and CEILINGS that indicate de-escalation or even dose removal when hit.

(I will prefer the terms FLOOR and CEILING because 'boundary' may suggest
a too-narrow 'topological' interpretation. We consider the boundary to
have been 'hit' (past participle!) even if the current tally lies INSIDE
the territory it bounds. If an accident at home results in a projectile
being embedded 1" into the ceiling or floor, rather than stuck at the
very surface, we still say the surface was hit.)

Arguably, sensible toxicity boundaries in dose-finding must take the form
of 'stairs' ascending from left to right in the T-N lattice depicted above.
Furthermore, adherence to 'reachability logic' effectively excludes step
heights greater than 1. (PROOF: Reachability effectively 'fills the corner'
in any proposed step of height 2, and this argument applies recursively to
higher steps.)

Thus all reasonable toxicity floors/ceilings can be constructed by a union
of 135-degree sectors generated by relations (_ &=< Q) and (_ &>= Q).
These unions are naturally represented as lists of the 'vertex tallies' Q.

Whereas step *heights* are always 1, the step *lengths* will generally be
longer---on the order of the reciprocal of the target toxicity rate (TTR).
Thus, we need not list a vertex tally for every denominator to define our
toxicity floors and ceilings.

For example, the decision boundaries from Liu & Yuan (2015) Table 1 ...

             cumulative patients treated at current dose (n_j):
              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12

lambda_{1,j} 0/1  0/2  0/3  0/4  0/5  0/6  0/7  1/8  1/9  1/10  1/11  1/12

lambda_{2,j} 1/1  2/2  2/3  2/4  3/5  3/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  5/11  6/12

elimination   -    -   3/3  3/4  3/5  4/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  6/11  6/12

... may easily be represented by short lists:

  Lambda_1 = [0/1, 1/8]

  Lambda_2 = [1/1, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 5/11, 6/12]

  Eliminate = [3/5, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12]

This is because, e.g.,

  maplist((Q &=<), [0/1, 1/8]) <==> maplist((Q &=<), [0/1,...,0/7,1/8,...]),

which is a consequence of the TRANSITIVITY of (&=<):

  Q =< 0/1 ==> Q =< 0/N =< 0/1 for N > 1;
  Q =< 1/8 ==> Q =< 1/N =< 1/8 for N > 8.

I wonder if CCDs have their own natural condensed representations.

First, consider how a pretty graphical layout would look.

For a trial that starts at dose 2:

0/0 0/1 0/0 0/0
     |
0/0 1/2 0/0 0/0
   /
0/1 1/2 0/0 0/0
 |
0/2 1/2 0/0 0/0
 |
0/3 1/2 0/0 0/0
   \
0/3 1/3 0/0 0/0

etc.

The diagram is clearer if we carry non-current tallies forward implicitly:

0/0 0/1 0/0 0/0
     |
    1/2
   /
0/1
 |
0/2
 |
0/3
   \
    1/3

Finally, the right or left margin could detail the binding constraint(s)
according to which each dose-escalation decision ( |, / or \) was made.
An attempt to escalate past top dose could be depicted with > in place of |.

-----

These visualizations also immediately suggest equivalent condensed string
expressions. Indeed, this can be done almost trivially by swapping / => :,
\ => ^, and | => -, in the implicit-LOCF form of the visualization.

For example, the above diagram immediately becomes:

(2) 0/1 - 1/2 : 0/1 - 0/2 - 0/3 ^ 1/3  

where the (2) indicates starting from dose-level 2. Alternatively, the
fully initial state of the trial could be specified instead, in an even
more direct transposition from the visualization format:

[0/0, 0/1, 0/0, 0/0] - 1/2 : 0/1 - 0/2 - 0/3 ^ 1/3.

-----

Other formats also suggest themselves as possibly more readable. Consider:

0/1@2 - 1/2@2 : 0/1@1 - 0/2@1 - 0/3@1 ^ 1/3@2,

or even

0/1@2 -x 1/2@2 :, 0/1@1 -o 0/2@1 -o 0/3@1 ^x 1/3@2,

which incorporates annotations for toxicity { o => 0, x => 1 }.

/*

How did I do this for 3+3, and what (if anything) has to change?


The indexing of cohorts on a per-dose basis nicely carries over into CCDs.
So the individual matrices T[,,j], j in 1..J retain the same form and semantics.
Furthermore, with a deterministic trial design, the path could be 'read out'
from these matrices quite straightforwardly.

But our plan for a more intimate involvement of Prolog in package 'precautionary'
happily liberates us from the supposed need to explicitly represent every step of
trial operation to R. When we need to determine properties of the trial paths at
such levels of detail, clearly the appropriate setting for the investigations is
Prolog itself. Thus, we need not even preserve all of the path information in the
cached arrays T[,,].

For CCDs with cohorts of 1, all R really needs to obtain from these arrays are
dose-wise tallies of x's and o's. This information suffices for computing path
probabilities and ordinalized toxicity rates, and indeed even for extracting the
dose recommendations provided that the stopping rule is CC-adapted and known via
context such as indexes into the data structure storing the designs' T[,,] arrays.

Thus, all we really need to extract for T[,,] output of each design is the final
state of ccd_decisions//1.

---

TODO: Note that 'cumulative-cohort matrices' (or 'cc matrices' for short) may
      better express the fact of our having eschewed a full path representation.
      OTOH, these matrices remain _summaries_ of the paths, and I'm not so sure
      that a term like 'path matrix' entails any kind of unique representation.

In terms of the actual tabular output to be read by R, a single row vector per
path seems ideal. The first element can be the selected dose, and this can be
followed by (T, N) pairs that even the human eye will be able to index easily.
