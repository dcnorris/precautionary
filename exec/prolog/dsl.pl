Here is a path-probability-weighted summary of des/sta/esc decisions
happening during operation of the Braun (2020) CRM model with C=13.
Note that there is a pretty sharp demarcation along boundaries in the
T-N plane.

This inspires for me the hope that designs formulated via constraints
may closely approximate even CRM designs.

I would like to specify dose-finding intuitions in the form of
forbidden events. With a suitable interpreter, I believe that
the 3+3 trial will lend itself to such definition.

Leaving aside for the moment the question of exactly HOW the
interpreter should work, let me articulate some constraints
that /with suitable interpretation/ MAY yield the 3+3 design.

===

Q1: Why do we escalate after observing 0/3?

A1: Because regret([sta, 0/6]).

---

Q2: Why do we DEescalate after 2+/3?

A2: Because regret([sta, 5/6]).

---

Q3: Why do we stay after 1/3?

A3: Hmm.. This one might be the source of some insight!

- What if I escalated after 1/3, and saw 3/3? Is this
  the outcome that looks regrettable in retrospect?
  How do I /articulate/ this regrettableness?

- OR.. is this better expressed in terms other than 'regret'?
  That is, should I say that escalating requires some 'support',
  which an observation of 0/3 provides?

- Are there HIGHER-LEVEL concepts at work, that deserve
  to be expressed in the DSL? For example, are there cohort
  sizes that I say inadequately explore a dose FOR A GIVEN
  PURPOSE?

- Then again, the excessive proliferation of extra concepts
  should be avoided assiduously! In these early explorations,
  my very first question should be, How much can I accomplish
  with a very small language?

- One useful principle might be that we always choose the next
  dose to be as high as allowed. (Maybe this is even a parameter
  that we could change via DSL!) If so, then Q3 gets further
  focused as, "Why DON'T we escalate after 1/3?"

- Keep in mind that Q3 may provoke the articulation of SEVERAL
  distinct principles. Remember, my aim is to develop insight
  at this stage!

PLAN from morning walk 8/28 ...

1. Generate common designs from regret-constrained (RC) formulations
(a) Standard 3+3
(b) Less common variant
(c) CCDs   

2. Rolling enrollment
(a) 3+3 Ã  la Frankel &al (2020) /JAMA Open/
(b) Rolling-6 (Skolnik &al 2008)

3. Approximating CRM
(a) Exhibit an RC design that contains all paths of the Braun2020 model.
    Demonstrate how much larger the path set is (probably a lot!) and
    characterize what decisional indeterminacy remains in the design.
(b) Find a principled way to remove sets of paths by adding RCs, and
    to characterize the path-set differences that arise along the way
    toward a design that is contained within the CRM.

% TODO:
% 1. How do I exclude possibilities without not/1 or all-solutions predicates?
%
% What is the proper STATUS of statements like regret/2?
% Are these actually to be implemented differently?

/*

I need to think 'from a logical point of view' at this point.
I would like to posit EXAMPLES of regrettable situations, and have these RESTRICT
the possible solutions. But this runs counter to the way pure logical programming
is supposed to work, such that adding more facts should only increase the number
of solutions.

Thus, the statement of regrettable situations is more like specifying CONSTRAINTS
as opposed to FACTS.

This reasoning seems to demand that I specify 'regret' in terms of CLP, and not
in terms of predicates or facts. The design is not written in Prolog, but in CLP!

*/

/*

I am beginning to think that the above observation is the crucial one. If I keep
trying to handle regret using Prolog, I'm working at cross purposes.

But now the question becomes, how do I incorporate CLP statements of regret into
the operation of the DCG that generates possible trial paths?

----------------------------------------

WAIT! Why can't I add 'regret' statements to Prolog's database, as constraints?
Why can't Prolog search every possible reason for regretting an action, and then
if it can't find one, do the action? Does this REALLY require not/1?

I THINK IT DOES! The trouble is, unless I commit to the discovery of a regret,
upon backtracking the list of regrets will get exhausted until the regretted
action is eventually taken anyway! Thus, taking the action requires satisfying
the goal of *NOT* REGRETTING. And there's the not/1!

BUT... might if_/3 be able to rescue me? Does it discard choice points purely?
If I understand it, YES!

But the price to pay for this is REIFICATION. I need to *reify* regret.
