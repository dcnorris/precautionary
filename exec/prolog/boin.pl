% Implementing BOIN within a larger class of designs.

/*

Having at last read [1] with an eye toward implementation, I see that BOIN
lends a formal status to a whole class of dose-escalation designs which may
prove extremely easy to implement and explore using Prolog.

Table 2 in the paper is especially helpful, suggesting that a general class
of transition rules may be relatively easy to specify in CLP terms, without
recourse to whatever Real-analytic computations might be used as heuristics
for *finding* them:

             cumulative patients treated at current dose (n_j):
              1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11    12

lambda_{1,j} 0/1  0/2  0/3  0/4  0/5  0/6  0/7  1/8  1/9  1/10  1/11  1/12

lambda_{2,j} 1/1  2/2  2/3  2/4  3/5  3/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  5/11  6/12

elimination   -    -   3/3  3/4  3/5  4/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  6/11  6/12


The dose-elimination concept also readily invites computations over *lists*,
which are subject to truncation in the same manner.

Furthermore, with the 'local BOIN' design having so few free parameters (indeed,
under the default choice delta = +/-40%, the target toxicity rate is all that we
have left!), we obtain the real possibility of caching precomputed T arrays for
a finite number of possible designs! Thus, we might cache BOIN T arrays on a grid
of (TTR,D) in {0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3} x {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8} which amounts to
only 30 distinct arrays. (An interesting question is whether it might suffice to
cache only the D=8 arrays, and then collapse these to the D<8 arrays by a quick
array computation. In this case, it might well be reasonable to cache on a finer
TTR grid.)

Also helpful for situating this type of design within a 'taxonomy' is [2], with
its notion of a 'cumulative cohort design'. This is a design where the escalation
decisions are made solely on the tally *at the current dose*, without regard to
the tallies at other doses. This is the basic pattern to be implemented here,
albeit with elimination of overly-toxic doses which departs from strict CCD form.

% My initial emphasis is on generating all possible paths (CPE) for the BOIN
% design set forth in the table above. Although the BOIN design of [1] lacks
% any terminating principle except elimination of all doses, we do need such
% a rule here. The most natural formtype of rule, in view of the Table above,
% might be a 'stop-for-consensus' type of rule as found in package 'dtpcrm'.
% This is specified as a maximum number of patients to enroll at any 1 dose.

/*

Under a scheme of rolling enrollment, we no longer have the alternating sequence
of enrollment and assessment 'coroutines'. Rather, the GENERAL state is one where
EITHER further enrollment or resolution of pending DLT assessments may occur.

What if I plunged in, and explicitly used Prolog's distinction between ground and
uninstantiated variables? The sequence of enrolled patients is then a list of vars,
each in domain 0..1. The state transitions consist of either the instantiation of
non-ground vars, or else the extension of the list with new enrollment. One happy
consequence of this design is that it looks open to generalization to ordinal tox.

*/

/*

That looks promising! So the state representation now becomes the previous
left-right lists, except that the element of these lists are themselves lists!

%% A fair enumeration of tallies will be helpful for developing
%% and testing comparison relations between tallies.

%% In general, I may require a max-enrollment *parameter*,

    ground(MaxN),
    Enrolled in 0..MaxN,

    indomain(DLTs).

%% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The BOIN rules suggest that comparisons of tallies might be generalized to
% comparisons between a tally and a *list* of tallies. Thus, e.g. the rule:
%
% lambda_{1,j} 0/1  0/2  0/3  0/4  0/5  0/6  0/7  1/8  1/9  1/10  1/11  1/12
%
% generates interest in comparisons such as T/N &=< [0/1, 0/2, 0/3, 0/4, ...].
%
% Does this comparison have an unambiguous or obvious meaning that might allow
% us to condense the list? It would be a shame to have to completely list all
% possible fractions in a sequence like this!
%
% With &=< at least, perhaps we would like to write instead:
%   T/N &=< [0/1, 1/8, 2/15],
% or possibly even abbreviate this as:
%   T/N &=< [1, 8, 15],
% although I am inclined to reject the latter as more 'cute' than *clear*.
%
% The comparison would then hold if ANY of the mapped comparisons holds.
%
% What about the flip-side?
%
% lambda_{2,j} 1/1  2/2  2/3  2/4  3/5  3/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  5/11  6/12
%
% Here, we require comparisons like T/N &>= [1/1, 2/2, 2/3, ...] or possibly
% T/N &>= [1/1, 2/4, 3/6, ...] or even T/N &>= [1, 4, 6, ...].

% Again, this complex comparison holds if ANY component comparison holds.

If I do 'cut out the middleman' in this way, what is the right representation
for the toxicity boundaries?

elimination   -    -   3/3  3/4  3/5  4/6  4/7  4/8  5/9  5/10  6/11  6/12

RELATIVE to a maximum cohort size of 12, the above boundaries gain sufficient
and minimal representation as the following lists:

lambda_1 [0/1, 1/8]
lambda_2 [1/1, 2/4, 3/6, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12]
elim     [3/5, 4/8, 5/10, 6/12]

This is because lambda_1 is a lower bounds, and so the removed limits were
non-binding. Likewise, since lambda_2 and elim were upper bounds the removed
limits were non-binding.

In general, minimal representations of tox boundaries will consist of lists
of tallies BdyRep satisfying:

minimal_maxn(BdyRep, MaxN) :-
    zip(Ts, Ns, BdyRep),
    T1 #=< Tn,
    Ts in T1..Tn,
