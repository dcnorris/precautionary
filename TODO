NEW & IMPROVED PLAN

So, the plan below evaporated quickly after a half-day of thinking
in my notebook! A new, more focused plan has emerged as follows:

(1) Initial target is a cross-tabulation by r0 and ordinal Tox,
    displaying counts of enrolled patients over all reps within
    each given draw from (sigma(CV), mu) and the 'true_prob_tox'
    vector that yields.
    
(2) That crosstab can then be normalized to expected numbers of
    each toxicity grade in the trial. (The sum of these of course
    yields the expected enrollment in the trial.)
    
(3) VISUALIZING this process seems essential for communicating
    the basic idea to oncology trialists. One such viz that comes
    to mind is a representative set of 20 or so 'true_prob_tox'
    curves (NB: these should be smoothed) that support roll-over
    interaction with a sub-table (inset?) display.

---

A key consideration as I begin, is how (and whether) to deal with
absolute vs ordinal doses. One possibility is to suppose that any
ordinal (1, 2, 3, ...) doses are scaled either logarithmically or
arithmetically (perhaps set by a package option), with a generic
case handled by a monotone function.

In case an optional vector of dimensioned doses is provided, then
the package should adapt printed displays to include these alongside
any dose level. (Also, concreteness being a cognitive convenience
for users, these absolute doses might also serve as references for
specification of MTDi distribution centrality. But such 'speculative
generality' might best be left as a later refinement.)

1. Implement MTDi.distribution package options(mu, CV, r0),
   defaulting to generally plausible values,
   
2. Redo the vignette by reference to these options

3. Investigate 'hiding' the extra work by shadowing method.
   This is an interesting possibility, which may even challenge
   usual notions of 'good programming practice' in R or on CRAN.
