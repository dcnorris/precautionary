<!--
My immediate aim here is to generate an HTML document
suitable for copy-n-paste into Tweetdeck or Twitter.

I regard this as an initial step toward a full-fledged
output format for sciencey threads on Twitter.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Together, this global counter plus 'tweet' chunk hook suffice to enable
# intercalating a Twitter 'commentary' thread within a larger html_document.
tweet_counter <- 0 # global counter
knitr::knit_hooks$set(tweet = function(before, options, envir){
  if (before) { # insert tweet text above any images
    tweet_counter <<- tweet_counter + 1
    tweet_numbering <- paste0(tweet_counter, "/")
    allotted <- 280 - nchar(tweet_numbering) - 1
    # TODO: Warn when---and by how much---a tweet exceeds character limit
    if (!is.null(options$link)) allotted <- allotted - 23*length(options$link)
    return(paste(paste(substr(paste(options$tweet, collapse="\n\n")
                             , 1, allotted)
                      , tweet_numbering)
                ,paste(options$link, collapse="\n\n")
                ,sep="\n\n"
                ))
  } else {
    return("\n\n---\n\n") # output an hline
  }
})
# For 'tweet' chunks, set echo=FALSE
knitr::opts_hooks$set(tweet = function(options) {
  options$echo <- FALSE
  options
})

# TODO: Consider whether an output hook will actually be needed,
#       if some amount of rendering gets done e.g. between $...$.
#       This is, after all, about 'sciencey' tweets, which are
#       inconceivable without math!
#       Note also that using *output* hooks would let me simply
#       'red' any character overages, a much more suitable way
#       to support drafting of threads.
# UHOH: BUT ... isn't this stuff that happens at PANDOC time?
#       Would I rather need a *pandoc* filter?
