# Generative models of binary and ordinal toxicities

# These generative models will abstract from 'true_tox_probs' in several dimensions:
# 1. There is a dimension of *uncertainty*, itself comprising 2 types:
# (a) There is a 'hyperparameter' dimension of (subjective, 'epistemic') uncertainty
#     about the population-level distribution of toxicity responses.
# (b) There is *aleatoric* ('purely statistical') uncertainty arising from the
#     random sampling that study enrollment amounts to.
# 2. There are questions of *pharmacologic realism*, including:
# (a) Deriving binary toxicities from latent u_i (equiv., MTDi)
# (b) Explicit dimensioning of doses
# (c) The scaling of the pharmacological effects of these doses
# (d) Elaboration of pharmacologic effects (e.g., *graded* toxicities)
#
# I have dealt with (1b) in isolation already, by generalizing 'simulate_trials'
# to the case where 'true_tox_probs' is (effectively) a matrix.
#
# A next step may be to handle (2a,b) *together*, in a class which allows for
# specification of an MTDi distribution over real doses.
# In constructing this class, I may wish to anticipate the need to abstract
# the parameter specification to facilitate (1a).

# The @ordinalizer slot is an optional 'mixin' defaulting to
# the absent case of a NULL body(). This function in general
# is a dose-space transformation that spreads any given dose
# into an ordered vector of doses at which graded toxicities
# occur.
# One appealing manner of specifying an @ordinalizer would be
# to take an MTDi3 as input dose, and output an ascending
# vector of doses c(MTDi1=, MTDi2=, ..., MTDi5=). But using
# this scheme would impose on my code the obligation to invert
# this relation.
# So instead, I will implement @ordinalizers directly through
# the inverse function, one that transforms a given dose into
# a *descending* vector of doses that yield equivalent rates
# of toxicity from the mtdi_generator.
# If I am using 5 toxicity grades (Gr1,..Gr5) and if we take
# MTDi to be the Gr3 threshold, then the @ordinalizer's task
# is to transform an given dose into Gr1..5 *equivalents*
# vis-Ã -vis the mtdi_generator. This is really so abstract
# that it may need to be hidden from users; consider.
# I will gain little from imposing premature concreteness,
# and indeed may obscure some essential aspects with excessive
# hand-holding. The user should perhaps be forced to specify
# the toxicity grades explicitly!
# Let me keep things simple by assuming this function is of
# a single dose, i.e., is NOT vectorized.
# Note that the 'optional' nature of the @ordinalizer carries
# through into the treatment of ordinal toxicity information
# using an attr(sims,'ordtox') which may or may not be NULL.
